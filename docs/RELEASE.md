# Mobile release runbook & checklist

How `apps/mobile` (the WhoCards Expo app) gets built, tested, and shipped. Decisions and
their trade-offs live in [ADR-0005](./adr/0005-mobile-release-pipeline.md); this is the
operational checklist.

**Tracking:** [#99](https://github.com/whocards/whocards-platform/issues/99) is the ordered v1.0
release epic. [#85](https://github.com/whocards/whocards-platform/issues/85) owns the audience and
post-launch growth workstream.

**Pipeline at a glance:** EAS Build + Submit · **beta-first** (TestFlight + Play testing →
promote to public) · OTA via EAS Update on a `fingerprint` runtime version · build numbers
auto-incremented by EAS · fully automated in CI on `v*` tags. The first Android release has an
additional mandatory Closed Testing gate before Google grants production access.

## Release vocabulary

- **Beta release:** the production binary is available to testers through TestFlight and Google
  Play testing. For the first Android release, the qualifying cohort must use **Closed Testing**;
  Internal Testing does not satisfy Google's production-access requirement.
- **Public release:** that validated binary is promoted to the public App Store and Google Play.
- **Campaign launch:** the coordinated audience moment after both public listings have been
  verified: `/app` flips to download mode, the announcement email goes out, and the website and
  social campaign turn on.

The launch campaign code lands **before** the public release with `/app` in waitlist mode. This
builds the email audience during the beta/review window. Public availability and the campaign
launch are deliberately separate checkpoints; do not send the announcement merely because a
binary was submitted.

**v1.0 scope:** landing → single WhoCards Deck → Global Game (swipe nav, 14 languages + RTL,
language persistence, share, offline Answer recording, branded splash/handoff). Out: Library
browse, Custom Decks, Personal Game, accounts/purchases, Facilitation (all future per CONTEXT.md).

## Local development — use a dev build, not Expo Go

This app uses custom native modules (`expo-dev-client`, `expo-updates`, `posthog-react-native`,
etc.) that Expo Go cannot load. **Do not use Expo Go for local development.** The `start` /
`ios` / `android` scripts already pass `--dev-client` so Metro targets the installed dev client.

### First time

Build and install a `development`-profile binary once per device/simulator. EAS builds it in the
cloud and distributes via internal distribution (no App Store):

```bash
pnpx eas-cli@latest build -p ios --profile development
pnpx eas-cli@latest build -p android --profile development
```

Or build locally with Xcode / Gradle:

```bash
pnpm -F mobile exec expo run:ios
pnpm -F mobile exec expo run:android
```

### Day-to-day

With the dev build installed, start Metro and connect:

```bash
pnpm -F mobile start        # opens the dev-client launcher
pnpm -F mobile ios          # boots the iOS simulator and connects
pnpm -F mobile android      # boots an Android emulator and connects
```

The dev-client launcher QR/URL connects to Metro just like Expo Go would, but uses the custom
native runtime that matches what ships in production.

## Phase 0 — One-time foundation

> **Android is back in the release** ([#27](https://github.com/whocards/whocards-platform/issues/27)) — a fresh Google
> Play account + service-account JSON are set up, and the release verified rendering on device. iOS and Android now
> build/submit together under the single `EAS_RELEASE_ENABLED` switch (the old `MOBILE_ANDROID_ENABLED` gate is removed).
> Remaining Android prerequisite: create the Play app record and hand-upload the first AAB (Google requires this before
> `eas submit -p android` works).

- [ ] **Accounts** — store accounts exist; the Play app record + first AAB remain (#27)
  - [x] Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) — enrolled; App Store Connect app record created (`ascAppId 6782853824`, Team ID `6RTC67K8CW`)
  - [x] Google Play Console ($25 one-time) — fresh dedicated account + service-account JSON set up
  - [ ] Google Play app record + Internal Testing track; hand-upload the first AAB before `eas submit -p android`
  - [x] Expo account / org (free) — projectId `70c97b4d…` wired into `app.json`; `EXPO_TOKEN` set as an Actions secret
- [x] **EAS init** — `projectId` committed to `app.json` (`extra.eas.projectId`)
- [x] **Credentials** — EAS-managed signing: iOS distribution cert + provisioning done (Android keystore deferred → #27). Local `credentials.json` is gitignored (it holds a plaintext cert password)
- [x] **Submit creds** — both stored on EAS and pulled by `eas submit` via `EXPO_TOKEN`, so neither is a CI secret: iOS App Store Connect API key (`eas credentials` → iOS → App Store Connect API Key) and Android Play service-account key (`eas credentials` → Android → Google Service Account) — no `serviceAccountKeyPath`
- [x] **`eas.json`** — `cli.appVersionSource: "remote"`; profiles `development` / `preview` / `production`; `autoIncrement` on `production`; per-profile `env` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`); channels `preview` / `production`
- [x] **OTA** — `expo-updates` added; `runtimeVersion: { "policy": "fingerprint" }` set in `app.json`
- [x] **CI** (GitHub Actions, `.github/workflows/`)
  - [x] PR/main workflow: the quality gate (`mobile-gate.yml`)
  - [x] Tag (`v*`) workflow: gate → `eas build` → `eas submit` (beta) → `eas update` (`mobile-release.yml`) — **inert until `EAS_RELEASE_ENABLED=true`** (iOS + Android together)
  - [x] Secrets: `EXPO_TOKEN` is the only CI secret; both the iOS ASC API key and Android Play key live on EAS (`eas credentials`), pulled by `eas submit`
- [ ] **`docs/mobile/README` / this runbook** linked from the repo README

## Phase 1 — Blockers before the first build

These make the binary correct; the app is broken or unshippable without them.

- [x] **Prod API URL** — `production` (and `preview`) profile sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://whocards.cc` in `eas.json` (app calls `/api/trpc`); without it the build falls back to `localhost:4321`. Prod API verified live 2026-06-21 (`/api/trpc/decks.manifest` & `pool.languages` → `200`, see #20).
- [x] **App display name** — `app.json` `name` is **WhoCards**; `slug` is `whocards-app` (matches the EAS project); iOS bundle ID is `cc.whocards.mobile` and Android package is `com.whocards.mobile`. (`scheme` stays `mobile` — that's the deep-link scheme, unrelated.)
- [x] **App icon** — WhoCards dark `?` mark (`icon.png` + Android adaptive icons); intentionally dark-only
- [x] **Version fields** — `version: "1.0.0"`; build numbers via EAS remote auto-increment (no manual `buildNumber`/`versionCode`)
- [x] **Error boundary** — root error boundary with recovery in `src/components/error-boundary.tsx`, mounted in `src/app/_layout.tsx`
- [ ] **Native review prompt in the v1 binary** — add `expo-store-review` before cutting the release
      candidate; direct native prompt after ≥10 answered Cards across ≥2 sessions, with no custom
      pre-prompt/review gating (#89)
- [ ] **Quality gate green** (see below)

## Phase 2 — Cut the first beta

- [ ] `eas build -p ios --profile production` and `eas build -p android --profile production`
- [ ] `eas submit -p ios` → TestFlight
- [ ] Hand-upload the first Android AAB to the Play app record and smoke it through Internal
      Testing (#27)
- [ ] Create the Android **Closed Testing** track and promote the validated AAB into it
- [ ] Recruit 18–20 Android testers through a dedicated #82/#96 tester Broadcast plus personal
      outreach; manage the cohort through one Google Group tied to the Closed Testing track
- [ ] Enrol the buffer cohort so **12 remain continuously opted in for 14 days** (the minimum
      required by Google); testers need Google accounts (#98)
- [ ] Send tester onboarding instructions, a day-7 feedback check-in, and a completion thank-you;
      opting out resets that tester's continuous-day count
- [ ] After day 14, apply for Google Play production access and answer the testing/readiness
      questionnaire; budget up to another 7 days for Google's review (#98)
- [ ] In parallel, submit the iOS release candidate for App Review with **manual release** selected;
      keep the approved version pending developer release while Android completes its gate
- [ ] **Device matrix smoke**: 2 iOS + 2 Android OS versions — launch, splash→landing handoff, play/swipe, language switch + RTL (Hebrew right-aligned), language persists across relaunch, share, **offline → reconnect drains the Answer queue**, deep-link/back
- [ ] File and fix anything found as `v1.0.x` (OTA if JS-only, rebuild if native)

## Phase 3 — Before promoting to public

- [ ] **Observability live** — production EAS builds include the PostHog EU project key; confirm events + JS errors arrive from the beta build
- [x] **Privacy Policy** — `whocards.cc/legal/pp` discloses the app's data: Device id, the Answer record, PostHog analytics
- [ ] **App Privacy (Apple) + Data Safety (Play)** forms filled to match (device id, usage/analytics; no tracking SDK unless added)
- [ ] **Store assets** — name, subtitle, description, keywords, category, support URL, and per-device-size screenshots (raw captures via `pnpm -F mobile screenshots`, #34; then frame/compose)
- [ ] **Permissions** — confirm only what's used (network, haptics); no stray permission pulled in by a dep
- [ ] Promote the **same** validated builds to the public App Store + Google Play in one coordinated
      release window; do not publish iOS early while Android is waiting for production access

## Phase 4 — Quiet production soak and campaign handoff

- [ ] Keep `PUBLIC_APP_LAUNCHED=false`; public availability is not yet the Campaign launch
- [ ] Confirm both public store pages and final IDs/URLs resolve on real iOS and Android devices
- [ ] Have the tester cohort install the **public** builds and repeat the critical journey: store →
      install → first play → language → share → background/reopen
- [ ] Verify website badges, device-aware ordering, Smart App Banner/app links, PostHog events and
      errors, Answer recording, privacy/support URLs, and the contact path
- [ ] Soak for 24 hours with no unresolved P0/P1 issue; fix with OTA only when the fingerprint is
      compatible, otherwise hold the campaign for a corrected binary
- [ ] Hand off to the Campaign launch runbook (#94): flip `/app`, enable CTAs, send the segmented
      launch Broadcast, and publish social posts

## Ongoing — the per-release loop

1. Land changes via PRs (CI gate must pass).
2. Decide the change type:
   - **JS/asset only** → `eas update --channel production` (OTA; no store round-trip). Same gate applies.
   - **Native change** (fingerprint shifts) or a marketing version bump → bump `version` if user-facing, tag `vX.Y.Z` → CI builds, submits to beta, promote after the device-matrix smoke.
3. Keep the device-matrix smoke for every native build; OTA pushes still pass the JS gate.

## Quality gate (build **and** OTA)

- [ ] `pnpm check` green (tsc + oxlint + oxfmt + `decks`/`api` unit tests + **mobile jest suite**)
- [ ] **Mobile unit/component tests** — `pnpm --filter mobile test` (jest + RN Testing Library; covers language-store, answer-queue, device-id, getBaseUrl, ErrorBoundary)
- [ ] **Maestro suite** — run `pnpm --filter mobile e2e:ios` and `pnpm --filter mobile e2e:android` (see `.maestro/README.md`). Offline-record→drain has no observable UI signal and is covered by the `answer-queue`/`answer-transport` jest tests instead.
- [ ] Manual smoke on the **device matrix** (native builds — see below)

## Device matrix

Manual smoke checklist for every native build (not required for OTA-only pushes).
Scenarios: launch→play→swipe, language switch + RTL (Hebrew), language persists across relaunch,
share, offline→reconnect Answer queue drain, deep-link/back.

| Platform | OS version | Notes                                  |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | iOS 17     | Latest stable; Simulator + real device |
| iOS      | iOS 16     | One major back; Simulator is fine      |
| Android  | Android 14 | API 34; emulator or real device        |
| Android  | Android 12 | API 31; covers ~50% of active installs |

## Hotfix & rollback

- **JS hotfix:** `eas update --channel production` (reaches compatible binaries only, per the fingerprint policy).
- **Rollback an OTA:** `eas update --channel production` re-publishing the last-good commit, or `eas update:rollback`.
- **Bad binary:** halt the store rollout (Play staged rollout / App Store phased release), ship a corrected build; OTA can't replace native code.
